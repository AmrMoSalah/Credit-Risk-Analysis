# Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is focused on **Credit Risk Analysis**, aiming to provide insights into borrowers’ profiles and the likelihood of default. The dashboard was built to analyze credit-related data and highlight patterns in borrower characteristics, loan distributions, and risk categories.  

The main objectives are:  
- To identify **borrower details** (age, income, employment, etc.)  
- To analyze **defaulters vs. non-defaulters**  
- To calculate the **total loan amount given per borrower**  
- To use **calculated columns** and **measures** for key financial ratios and KPIs
