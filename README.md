Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project is focused on Credit Risk Analysis, aiming to provide insights into borrowers’ profiles and the likelihood of default. The dashboard was built to analyze credit-related data and highlight patterns in borrower characteristics, loan distributions, and risk categories.

The main objectives are:

To identify borrower details (age, income, employment, etc.)

To analyze defaulters vs. non-defaulters

To calculate the total loan amount given per borrower

To use calculated columns and measures for key financial ratios and KPIs

📊 Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Borrower Demographics: Age, income, employment, home ownership.

Loan Insights: Loan grade, intent, interest rate, loan amount.

Default Analysis: Number and percentage of defaulters vs. clients.

KPIs & Ratios: Loan-to-income ratio, debt-to-income ratio, credit history length.

Interactive Filters: Slice and dice the data by borrower risk category, loan grade, and more.
